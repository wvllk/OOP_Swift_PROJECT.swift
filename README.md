# OOP_Swift_PROJECT.swift

This program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Swift.

The program defines a base class Vehicle that represents a general vehicle object. The Car and Truck classes inherit from the Vehicle class, and add additional properties specific to cars and trucks. This is an example of inheritance, where the subclasses inherit properties and methods from the parent class.

Each class has an initializer method that sets the properties of the object when it is created. This is an example of encapsulation, where the properties and behavior of an object are contained within the object.

The displayInfo() method is defined in the Vehicle class, and is called on each object to display the information about the vehicle. This is an example of polymorphism, where different objects can be treated the same way and called using the same method.
